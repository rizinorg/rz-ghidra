# r2ghidra-dec

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/radareorg/r2ghidra-dec.svg?token=JDmXp2pDhXxtPErySVHM&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/radareorg/r2ghidra-dec)

This is an integration of the Ghidra decompiler for [radare2](https://github.com/radareorg/radare2).
It is solely based on the decompiler part of Ghidra, which is written entirely in
C++, so Ghidra itself is not required at all and the plugin can be built self-contained.

## Installing

An r2pm package is available that can easily be installed like:
```
r2pm -i r2ghidra-dec
```

This package only installs the radare2 part.
To use r2ghidra from cutter, either use a provided pre-built release starting with
Cutter 1.9, which bundles r2ghidra, or follow the build instructions below.

## Usage

```
Usage: pdg   # Native Ghidra decompiler plugin
| pdg           # Decompile current function with the Ghidra decompiler
| pdgd          # Dump the debug XML Dump
| pdgx          # Dump the XML of the current decompiled function
| pdgj          # Dump the current decompiled function as JSON
| pdgo          # Decompile current function side by side with offsets
| pdgs          # Display loaded Sleigh Languages
| pdg*          # Decompiled code is returned to r2 as comment
```

The following config vars (for the `e` command) can be used to adjust r2ghidra's behavior:

```
    r2ghidra.cmt.cpp: C++ comment style
 r2ghidra.cmt.indent: Comment indent
  r2ghidra.highlight: Enable/disable syntax highlighting
     r2ghidra.indent: Indent increment
       r2ghidra.lang: Custom Sleigh ID to override auto-detection (e.g. x86:LE:32:default)
    r2ghidra.linelen: Max line length
   r2ghidra.nl.brace: Newline before opening '{'
    r2ghidra.nl.else: Newline before else
 r2ghidra.sleighhome: SLEIGHHOME
```

Here, `r2ghidra.sleighhome` must point to a directory containing the `*.sla`, `*.lspec`, ... files for
the architectures that should supported by the decompiler. This is however set up automatically when using
the r2pm package or installing as shown below.

## Building

First, make sure the submodule contained within this repository is fetched and up to date:

```
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Then, the radare2 plugin can be built and installed as follows:

```
mkdir build && cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=~/.local ..
make
make install
```

Here, set the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` to a location where radare2 can load the plugin from.
The install step is necessary for the plugin to work because it includes installing the necessary Sleigh files.

To also build the Cutter plugin, pass `-DBUILD_CUTTER_PLUGIN=ON -DCUTTER_SOURCE_DIR=/path/to/cutter/source` to cmake.
